I made this simply to test using the Johnny-Five library and Socket.io as I have been playing around with Arduino and sensors lately.
I am terrible with C++ and slightly below mediocre with Javascript so I wanted to give this a try. I am using a simple RGB Led sensor connected to PINS 11, 12, and 13 and 3 toggle checkboxes to control the light.
